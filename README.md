# Python Course - Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project is part of the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code). It focuses on learning the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

## 📌 Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code using **classes** and **objects**. It allows for modular, reusable, and scalable code.

## 🚀 Topics Covered
